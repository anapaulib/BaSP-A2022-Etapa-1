### Week 00
As a team, we created the screenflow of the web page in Figma.
My group was in charge of the Landing page for desktop.
I was in charge of the screens and flow related to SignUp and LogIn.
### Week 01
Each one of the team created an html file recreating the Home page of the Landing page for desktop from the Figma file of week 00. No styles were added this week.
### Week 02
Each one of the team worked in his own html file from week 01 making correction from our tutors and adding styles in css to recreate the Landing page to desktop from the Figma file of week 00. No responsive styles were added this week.
### Week 03
Each one of the team worked in his own html and css files from week 02 making corrections from our tutors. Later on, each one added styles using flexbox in order to make the landing page responsive for mobile, tablet and laptop.
